    <p class="year">(2023)</p>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Since I was a freshman, I had always found the the school’s one-for-all student information page (named MySJSU)
        difficult to navigate. Even as a senior, I still find myself struggling to find certain information because the
        portal is overpopulated with links. There is no visual cue on where to look and MySJSU commits the gravest sin
        of
        all: it's very ugly.
    </p>
    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        While I know I'm not alone in trying to navigate the site, I didn't know exactly what were the pain points that
        everyone else experienced. I sent out a survey to gather what other students think about MySJSU and how they
        feel using it. Six students had responded.
    </p>
    <p>
        A majority of the answers lay in the center of the scale, indicating that most students feel that MYSJSU is
        satisfactory, but not completely satisfied with it
        <br><br>
        I polled them on which areas of MYSJSU they frequently used and found that MyProgress, Messages, and MyScheduler
        are the most commonly used on the page.
        <br><br>
        In the long answer response, it appears that most students would prefer their MYSJSU page to be more
        straightforward.
    </p>
    <h1>Wireframe/Mockup</h1>
    <p>
        When designing a new mockup for MYSJSU, I decided to break the site down into big shapes, so whatever that fell
        under one umbrella would be in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Figma, I created more or less the same big shapes for my low fidelity prototypes and expanded upon the colors
        and layout design.
    </p>
    <h1>Result</h1>
    <p>
        I simplified the overall design by a lot, keeping everything into specific sections, allowing the eye to scan
        over information quickly. I removed all the links and words for a cleaner interface.
        <br><br>
        The search bar was bigger now and right next to the title
        of the page, so it would be one of the first things the user would look at when the page finished loading.

    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        When processing my research information, I realized that I neglected the other portions of the student center
        that other users might’ve used in my survey. I made a mistake in limiting the choices to only those five tools.
        <br><br>
        Another thing I realized was that I would’ve liked to see a first-time user try to interact with the old MYSJSU
        page because it would’ve shown me the pain points of the old design.
